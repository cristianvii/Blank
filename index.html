<h3>1. Root Chakra (Muladhara)</h3>
  <p>The Muladhara, or root chakra, represents our foundation. On the human body, 
      it sits at the base of the spine and gives us the feeling of being grounded.
      When the root chakra is open, we feel confident in our ability to withstand 
      challenges and stand on our own two feet. When it's blocked, we feel threatened, 
      as if we're standing on unstable ground.</p>

<h3>2. Sacral Chakra (Swadhisthana)</h3>
  <p>The Swadhisthana, or sacral chakra, helps inform how we relate to our emotions 
      and the emotions of others. It also governs creativity and sexual energy. Those 
      with a blocked sacral chakra could feel a lack of control in their lives.</p>

<h3>3. Solar Plexus Chakra (Manipura)</h3>
  <p>The third chakra, the solar plexus chakra, speaks to your ability to be confident
      and in control of your life. Think back to the last time you had butterflies or 
      felt a pit in the stomach: That's the Manipura chakra at work. If your solar plexus
      chakra is blocked, you might feel overwhelming amounts of shame and self-doubt. 
      Those with open sacral chakras are free to express their true selves.</p>

<h3>4. The Heart Chakra(Anahata)</h3>
  <p>The Anahata, or heart chakra, is the bridge between the lower chakras (associated with
  materiality) and the upper chakras (associated with spirituality). As the name suggests, 
  this chakra can influence our ability to give and receive love—from others and ourselves. 
  Someone with a blocked heart chakra will have difficulty fully opening up to the people in
  their life. If someone's heart is open, they can experience deep compassion and empathy.</p>
      
<h3>5. Throat Chakra (Vishuddha)</h3>
  <p>The Vishuddha, or throat chakra, gives voice to the heart chakra and controls our ability
    to communicate our personal power. When it's functioning at full capacity, it allows us to
    express ourselves truly and clearly. Someone with a blocked throat chakra will feel like they
    have trouble finding the words to say how they truly feel.</p>

<h3>6. Third-Eye Chakra (Ajna)</h3>
<p>As we move up the body, we're getting closer to communion with the divine. The Anja, or third-eye
  chakra, controls our ability to see the big picture and connect to intuition. Think of it as the 
  eye of the soul: It registers information beyond the surface level. Visions and intuitive hits are 
  not uncommon for someone with an open third-eye chakra.</p>

<h3>7. Crown Chakra (Sahasrara)</h3>
<p>The Sahasrara, or crown chakra, the highest chakra, sits at the crown of the head and represents 
  our ability to be fully connected spiritually. When you fully open your crown chakra—something very
  few people ever do!—you're able to access a higher consciousness.</p>
